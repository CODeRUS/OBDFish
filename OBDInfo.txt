Sequence of ELM327 initializing:
- ATZ: reset ELM327
- ATD: set ELM327 to factory settings
- AT L0: switch line feed off
- AT E1: keep echo to detect if ELM327 understood a command
- AT H0: switch off headers (don't know if this is good. Let's see...)

Sequence of finding the right protocol(s)
- AT SP 1: select first protocol  (valid protocols 01 - 0C)
  - 0100: send command for first OBD mode (valid modes 01-0A). This command also retrieves which PID's are supported in this mode.
  If an answer comes then we have multiple infos: 1. the protocol is OK. 2. the mode is OK. 3. PID's supported in this mode
  - 0200: send command for second OBD mode
  - go through all other modes in this protocol
  ...
- AT SP 2: select the second protocol
  - 0100: ...
  
  Show trouble codes:
  For this operation, mode 01 and mode 03 has to be supported!!!
  - 0101: show how many trouble codes are stored
  - 03: show stored trouble codes
