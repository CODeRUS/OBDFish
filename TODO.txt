-------------BUGS/ERRORS-------------------
- Sometimes there is a segmentation fault when connecting via bluetooth
	bash: line 1:  6071 Segmentation fault      DISPLAY=':0.0' QT_NO_JOURNALD_LOG='1' /usr/bin/harbour-obdfish


--------------ToDo's for immediate future (before next release)---------------
- Check if bluetooth is activated on smartphone
- Dynamic pages: some texts are too wide. Do something about it...
- Cover page: show if connected or connecting ...
- Add more PID's


--------------ToDo's for near future---------------
- switch between metric/imperial units


--------------ToDo's for far future---------------
- Check MIL in init process on mainpage. If it is set, show a warning.

- Don't know what informations to view on the cover page. Need input from users...

- Make a VIN decoder (first only VW)
	- for every car brand an own JS library file
	- JS library has a generic function to decode
	- JS library has all lists which are needed to decode VIN. E.g. models, manufacturing date , ...

- Build in special PID requests, e.g. only working for Volkswagen
	- find a list of known PID's and how to deal with them
