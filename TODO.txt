-------------BUGS/ERRORS-------------------
- Sometimes there is a segmentation fault when connecting via bluetooth
	bash: line 1:  6071 Segmentation fault      DISPLAY=':0.0' QT_NO_JOURNALD_LOG='1' /usr/bin/harbour-obdfish


--------------ToDo's for immediate future (before next release)---------------
- Check if bluetooth is activated on smartphone


--------------ToDo's for near future---------------
- general settings page: query parameters in init routine on main page. Make parameters global.
- Check MIL in init process on mainpage. If it is set, show a warning.
- Add more PID's


--------------ToDo's for far future---------------
- Add debug file which holds errors and problems detected by the software

- Don't know what informations to view on the cover page. Need input from users...

- Make a VIN decoder (first only VW)
	- for every car brand an own JS library file
	- JS library has a generic function to decode
	- JS library has all lists which are needed to decode VIN. E.g. models, manufacturing date , ...

- Build in special PID requests, e.g. only working for Volkswagen
	- find a list of known PID's and how to deal with them

- Read trouble codes from PID area 0300
	- Problem is here that these codes might be manufacturer dependent.
	- I need to find out how to trigger a trouble code with my car.
	- The trouble codes should be viewed in a new dialog.

- Reset trouble codes
	- The ELM327 allows to reset triggered trouble codes.
	- Is this maybe manufacturer dependent? I won't do this if there is some chance of bricking the car controller!!!
	- Send a mode 04 command to the ELM. Do this only if there are trouble codes.
