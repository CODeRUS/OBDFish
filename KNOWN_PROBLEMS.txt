1. ISSUE: Cars with multiple controllers
----------------------------------------
EXPLANATION:
Some cars have two or more controllers, e.g. an engine controller and a transmission controller.
So if a PID is requested from ELM327, there might be multiple answers to the request.
The app has to check if there are more than one controller and how man there are.
THINGS TO CLARIFY:
Problem would be if a second controller would only answer to some PID requests but not to all.
In this case the app would have to go through all the PID's in the init process to determine which one is answered by multiple controllers.
SOLUTION:
Question is then how the app should deal with this.
One concept would be to let the user choose the controller.
Maybe on the settings page for the dynamic pages the user could choose the controller.


2. ISSUE: CAN mode (ISO 15765-4)
------------------
EXPLANATION:
In this mode, the ELM327 behaves completely different.
Mainly the answers to a PID request are different.
THINGS TO CLARIFY:
Is it feasible to build this into the app? Do users need this?
I need a car which behaves like this!!!
SOLUTION:
Possible place for implementation: in the main JS library in the functions to convert the bytes to useful data.
